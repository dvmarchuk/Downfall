New game
You play as Eagle Max Power, elite special trooper from MarzSec, a secret unit of the US Army.
While on patrol around the Martian wasteland a portal opened in the middle of your base. Tyroids
and Flynoids from the planet Schrogun 6 invaded from the portal and took over your base. King
Ralphie has taken Commander McG hostage in the bridge and are wiping out all life on mars. Are 
you a bad enough dude to rescue rescue McG?

End game
You saved McG! He was able to craft a dark matter disruptor using spare parts around the base.
With this disruptor you were able to close the portal and send a chain reaction to their base and
destroy their portal creating capabilities, preventing future invasions. The survivors on base
were able to fully repair all major systems, but could not fix the coffee machine. With your
actions you singlle handedly saved human settlement on mars for future generations.
